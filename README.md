Dataset: Amazon Fine Food Reviews 
I used the “Amazon Fine Food Reviews” dataset, which contains nearly 500,000 food-
related product reviews, user ratings (1–5 stars), review texts, and other metadata. Your goal 
is to build models that predict the sentiment (star rating) of a review based on its text, using 
three different vectorization approaches.
